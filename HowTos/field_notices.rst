Field Notice 0003 (2018/12/1)
--------------------------------
**TGW Orchestrator customers: Incorrect route advertisements from Aviatrix gateway to on-premise networks affecting 4.0 releases prior to 4.0.590 for TGW Hybrid Connection**

Problem:
If you use Aviatrix TGW Orchestrator and `build hybrid connection using Step 4, 5 and 6 <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/tgw_plan.html#optional-setup-aviatrix-transit-gw>`_, Aviatrix Transit gateway always advertises 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16 to on-prem.  This could affect the on-premise networks if the on-prem routers also advertise any of the three routes. 

Description:
Aviatrix transit gateways use BGP to summarize and propagate the network routes. Due to an unexpected software change, software releases from 4.0.368 to 4.0.589 advertises 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16 routes to on-prem which affects the on-prem network if the on-prem routers also advertise any of the three routes. This issue has been fixed in 4.0.590 and all customers who have deployed TGW are advised to upgrade to 4.0.590 or later, immediately.

Solution:
Customers deploying TGW are requested to upgrade to 4.0.590 or later. Please follow the instructions `here <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/inline_upgrade.html#how-to-upgrade-software>`__ to perform the software upgrade. After upgrading to 4.0.590 or later, please go to TGW Orchestrator > Plan > Step 7 to detach Aviatrix Transit GW from TGW and re-attach Aviatrix Transit GW to TGW in Step 6.

Note this issue does not affect customers who are not deploying TGW Orchestrator. But if you have plans to deploy, we advise you to upgrade to the latest software.

**Route update propagation inconsistency from on-premise networks affecting 3.5 releases prior to 3.5.362 for Transit Network**

Problem:
BGP Route propagation could fail intermittently from on-premise networks to cloud networks in Transit Network.

Description:
Aviatrix controllers and gateways use BGP to summarize and propagate the network routes. Due to an unexpected software change, 3.5 releases prior to 3.5.362 are affected and cannot forward routes in certain scenarios. This issue has been addressed in 3.5.362 and all customers who have deployed Transit Network and are running any 3.5 release prior to 3.5.362 are advised to upgrade to 3.5.362 or later, immediately. Customers who are running software version prior to 3.5 are not impacted by this issue.

Solution:
Customers deploying Transit Network are requested to upgrade to 3.5.362 or later, if they are running any 3.5.(<362) release. Please follow the instructions `here <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/inline_upgrade.html#how-to-upgrade-software>`__ to perform the software upgrade.

**SSL UserVPN with SAML function might fail with Chrome v70**
 
Problem
Remote users connecting via SSL UserVPN functionality authenticated through SAML cannot establish session.
 
Description
Aviatrix controllers and gateways provide SSL UserVPN service with authentication through SAML as described in `this doc <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/VPN_SAML.html>`_. Google Chrome v70 has altered the behavior of an element in HTML (they add an extra whitespace). This affects our product’s ability to interface with the SAML id providers and breaks the authentication process, resulting in remoteVPN users not being able to connect to your network. We have notified Google about this issue.
 
Solution
Customers deploying SSL UserVPN with SAML authentication are requested to upgrade to 3.5.362 or later, if they are running 3.3 or later release. Please follow the instructions `here <https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/inline_upgrade.html#how-to-upgrade-software>`__ to perform the software upgrade. For software version prior to 3.3, please reach out to us at support@aviatrix.com. Another workaround to restore the service to your users is to use Firefox as their default browser.
